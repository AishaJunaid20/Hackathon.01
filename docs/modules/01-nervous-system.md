# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2 Fundamentals)

In the realm of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics, effective communication and control are paramount. Just as a biological nervous system coordinates actions and transmits sensory information throughout a body, a robot requires a robust and flexible middleware to manage its complex array of sensors, actuators, and intelligent processing units. This module introduces you to the **Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2)**, the industry-standard framework that serves as the "nervous system" for modern robotic platforms.

Through this module, you will gain a foundational understanding of how ROS 2 facilitates modular and distributed robotic applications. You'll learn the core concepts that enable different components of a robot (such as its vision system, motor controllers, and AI brain) to communicate seamlessly, allowing for sophisticated behaviors and autonomous operation in dynamic environments. Mastering ROS 2 is crucial for anyone looking to develop, deploy, and scale intelligent robots capable of real-world interaction.

## Core Concepts

### ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services
Understanding the fundamental communication blocks of robotics.
- **Nodes**: Individual processes that perform computation.
- **Topics**: Publish/Subscribe messaging for continuous data (e.g., sensor streams).
- **Services**: Request/Reply messaging for discrete actions.

### Bridging Python Agents
Connecting high-level AI logic to low-level control.
- Using `rclpy` to bridge Python agents to ROS controllers.

### Unified Robot Description Format (URDF)
- Defining the physical structure of humanoids.
- Joints, links, and visual/collision meshes.
