# Assessments

Students will be evaluated through a series of practical projects demonstrating their mastery of Physical AI concepts.

## Core Projects

### 1. ROS 2 Package Development
Create a custom ROS 2 package that orchestrates multiple nodes to perform a complex control task.
*   **Focus**: Module 1 (Nervous System)

### 2. Gazebo Simulation Implementation
Build a simulation environment with a robot model (URDF), physics properties, and simulated sensors.
*   **Focus**: Module 2 (Digital Twin)

### 3. Isaac-based Perception Pipeline
Implement a computer vision pipeline using Isaac ROS to detect and classify objects in a simulated environment.
*   **Focus**: Module 3 (AI-Robot Brain)

## Capstone Project: The Autonomous Humanoid

**Weight**: 40% of Final Grade

A final integrated project where a simulated humanoid robot demonstrates full autonomy:
1.  **Conversational Interface**: Receives a natural language command via voice.
2.  **Cognitive Planning**: Decomposes the command into actions.
3.  **Navigation**: Autonomous movement in a complex environment.
4.  **Manipulation**: Successfully grasping and manipulating a target object.
